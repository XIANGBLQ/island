abstract: This is my first attempt at Jekyll and is a website designed to look just like a Latex document.

<p class="Section" style=" text-align:center;">前 &ensp; 言</p>
    <p class="LatexAbstractText">就目前的城镇生活污水处理情况来看，我国仍主要以传统的污水处理技术为核心。
        存在处理水平低、投资运行费用高等问题。

<p class="Section" style=" text-align:center;">摘 &ensp; 要</p>
<p class="BodyText">This has been my first attempt at Jekyll and with such it is likely not too great. I'd like to design this to work a bit more seamlessly aka without inline styling in the page.
    I imagine this is possible but not too sure how to do it yet. I also want to add more Latex style designs such as designed lists and sub sections etc.

<p class="LatexAbstract">Abstract</p>
<p class="LatexAbstractText">
    Farmland drainage is one of the main output way for agricultural non-point source pollution. It is of high quantity, and is a stable pollution source. Large amounts of farmland drainage without any purification
directly discharge into receiving waters, It not only wastes water resources, but also makes receiving waters pollution. Constructed wetland
is a new ecological method to purify wastewater, and is of significant environmental benefits. The northeast farmland drainage was chosen to study. Based on the characteristics of water quality and water quantity of
 farmland drainage, combined with the effluent quality requirements, a hybrid subsurface flow constructed wetland was designed. Devices in the
 laboratory were built. Through filtering design parameters, the process and parameters of constructed wetland sewage treatment were designed,
 and a layout of the structures was drawn. The main conclusions were shown as follows:

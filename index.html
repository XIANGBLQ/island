    <p class="BodyText">This has been my first attempt at Jekyll and with such it is likely not too great. I'd like to design this to work a bit more seamlessly aka without inline styling in the page.
        I imagine this is possible but not too sure how to do it yet. I also want to add more Latex style designs such as designed lists and sub sections etc.

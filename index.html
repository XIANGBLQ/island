<p class="Section" style=" text-align:center;">前 &ensp; 言</p>
    <p class="BodyText">就目前的城镇生活污水处理情况来看，我国仍主要以传统的污水处理技术为核心。
        存在处理水平低、投资运行费用高等问题。近几十年来，生物净化污水法优势越来越明显，主要包括传统活性污泥法、A/O 法、
        AB法、氧化沟、SBR 序列间歇式活性污泥法、生态浮床和人工湿地等。关于人工湿地的污水处理效率、植物搭配、基质研究、微生物选取等方面的研究和应用始终未停，从基
        底搭配中粉煤灰固废二次利用，到不同气候湿地植物搭配选择、种植，再到不同污水处理体系中微生物种类筛选，最后是人工湿地与其他污水处理技术的联用，因此近年来关于人工湿
        地基本物质、水生植物、微生物等方面的研究不断推进。

<p class="BodyText">This has been my first attempt at Jekyll and with such it is likely not too great. I'd like to design this to work a bit more seamlessly aka without inline styling in the page.
    I imagine this is possible but not too sure how to do it yet. I also want to add more Latex style designs such as designed lists and sub sections etc.

<p class="BodyText">
    Farmland drainage is one of the main output way for agricultural non-point source pollution. It is of high quantity, and is a stable pollution source. Large amounts of farmland drainage without any purification
directly discharge into receiving waters, It not only wastes water resources, but also makes receiving waters pollution. Constructed wetland
is a new ecological method to purify wastewater, and is of significant environmental benefits. The northeast farmland drainage was chosen to study. Based on the characteristics of water quality and water quantity of
 farmland drainage, combined with the effluent quality requirements, a hybrid subsurface flow constructed wetland was designed. Devices in the
 laboratory were built. Through filtering design parameters, the process and parameters of constructed wetland sewage treatment were designed,
 and a layout of the structures was drawn. The main conclusions were shown as follows:
